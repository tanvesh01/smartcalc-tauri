# SmartCalc ![Build Status](https://github.com/tanvesh01/smartcalc-tauri/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)

It is new way to do calculate on-fly. Do your calculation on text based queries and see the result immediately. Still it is under development but it is enough to use it on daily purpose. Supports money conversion, percentage calculation and basis time calculation but still not fully supported. For now, we support only in english language but if any want to help to translate, we can easily integrate new language.

## Why SmartCalc?

You can download the application or you can use it on the web. If you want you can integrate into your own product and it is totally free. Supports multiple type to do dailly basic calculation based on requirements.
**SmartCalc** helps long-term calculation based on your requirements and real-world problems and simplifies to use it in the text. If you want to buy a house and you don't know how much money you need to save for initial payment, you can do it very easily at **SmartCalc**. Or you can just do a simple calculations of how old you are.

### Number

You can do normal mathematical calculation with SmartCalc

```
10 * 20        |        200
30 / 3         |         10
10 * 20 + 40   |        240
10 / 3         |          3.33333333
100 to binary  |  0b1100100
100 to oct     |      0o144
100 to hex     |       0x64
```

Also support percentage calculation.

```
10% of 200    |  20
10% off 200   | 180
10% on 200    | 220
120 + 10%     | 132
500 - 30%     | 350
```

Percentage calculation applied to currencies.

```
10% of 200 try    | ₺20,00
10% off 200 try   | ₺180,00
10% on 200 try    | ₺220,00
120 usd + 10%     | $132.00
500 euro - 30%    | 350,00 €
```

The system supports a little bit of complex calculation like

```
15.5 is what % of 1100   |   %14.09
180 is 10% of what       |   1.800
```

### Date, Time and Timezone

Dynamically date and time calculation supported. If you want to do count days or diff dates, it is very easy now. Also, timezone conversion are supported.

```
today                    |   15 February
tomorrow                 |   16 February
yesterday                |   14 February
12/02/2020 - 1 days      |   11 Feb 2020
tomorrow + 3 weeks       |    9 March
3/3/2021 to 1/1/2000     |   21 years 2 months 1 week
100 minutes 1 seconds    |    1 hour 40 minutes 1 second
11:30 add 30 minute      |   12:00:00 CET
11:30 to EST             |   05:30:00 EST
```

Unix timestamp conversion is very easily.

```
1646401747 to date      | 4 March 14:49:07 CET
1 oct 2022 as unix      | 1664582400
x = 1664582400 to date  | 1 October 01:00:00 CET
x to UTC                | 1 October 00:00:00 UTC
```

### Memory

You can also do computer memory unit calculations.

```
1024 mb                  |   1.024MB
1 megabyte               |   1MB
1mb to byte              |   1.048.576byte
```

Also, abbreviation supported for all number types.

```
$1k                      |   $1,000.00
1M + 1k                  |   1.001.000
```

### Number Type Conversion

Programmers can convert numbers from one type to another type.
Here is the supported types:

- Octal
- Hexadecimal
- Decimal
- Binary

To use all number types except hexa, you must use the type's name. Since the word hexadecimal is long, hex word can be used.

```
10 hex                   |   0xA
10 hex to octal          |   0o12
0x12 to binary           |   0b10010
data = 10 hex            |   0xA
data decimal             |   10
```

### Length and Weight Conversion

Metric and Imperial units(some of them) conversion supports. You can convert one to other type easily.

```
1 m to mm                | 1,000 Millimeter
1 yard to inch           |    36 Inch
100 yard to mile         |     0.06 Mile
1 Stone to kg            |     6.35 Kilogram
10 pound to ounce        |   160 Ounce
```

### Variable definition

You can store information in variable and use it again in formulas.

```
gross salary = 100k dkk           | 100.000,00 kr.
net salary   = gross salary - %40 |  60.000,00 kr.
daily wages  = net salary / 30    |   2.000,00 kr.
as euro = daily wages as euro     |     268,82 €
as euro                           |     268,82 €
```
